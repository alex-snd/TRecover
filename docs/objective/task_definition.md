# üöÄ Task definition

!!! important "Abstract"

    <h3 align="justify">The main goal of the project is to explore the possibility of using the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer neural network</a> 
    to ‚Äúread‚Äù meaningful text in columns for the English language that can be compiled for a 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_key_cipher">Running Key Cipher</a>.</h3>

## Notations

For a clearer explanation of the problem, let me introduce the following concepts.

<p align="justify">
    Let \(A\) be the alphabet of the English language, the letters of which are arranged in natural order. The 
   \(\alpha + \gamma = \beta \,\) notation will be understood as the modular addition of letter numbers from  
   \(\{ 0, \, 1, \, 2, \, ... \, , \, |A|- 1 \}\) modulo \(|A|\), where \(\alpha, \, \gamma, \, \beta \in A\). 
    That is, when encrypting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext">plaintext</a>, we will identify letters 
    with their numbers in the alphabet\(A\).
</p>

## Simple case

<p align="justify">
    Let's consider a simple example in which only two letters \(\gamma', \, \gamma'' \in A\) can be used as 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystream">keystream</a> 
    \(\bar{\gamma}=(\gamma_1, \, \gamma_2, \, ‚Ä¶ \, , \, \gamma_n)\) values, that is, the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext">ciphertext</a> 
    \(\bar{\beta}=(\beta_1, \, \beta_2, \, ‚Ä¶ \, , \, \beta_n)\) formation equation has the form 
    \(\alpha_i + \gamma_i = \beta_i, \; i \in \{1, \, 2, \, ‚Ä¶ \, , \, n\}\), where \(n\) is the length of the message. 
    In this case, recovering the plaintext \(\bar{\alpha}=(\alpha_1, \, \alpha_2, \, ... \, , \, \alpha_n)\) by ciphertext
    \(\bar{\beta}\) isn't difficult. Indeed, we will make up the columns 
    \(\bar{\nabla}=(\bar{\nabla_1}, \, \bar{\nabla_2}, \, ... \, , \, \bar{\nabla_n})\) according to the known ciphertext 
    \(\bar{\beta}\), where \(\bar{\nabla_i}=(\beta_i-\gamma', \, \beta_i-\gamma''), \; i \in \{1, \, 2, \, ... \, , \, n\}\):
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table align="center">
       <tr align="center"><td>\(\beta_1-\gamma'\)</td><td>\(\beta_2-\gamma'\)</td><td>\(\beta_3-\gamma'\)</td><td>\(...\)</td><td>\(\beta_n-\gamma'\)</td></tr>
       <tr align="center"><td>\(\beta_1-\gamma''\)</td><td>\(\beta_2-\gamma''\)</td><td>\(\beta_3-\gamma''\)</td><td>\(...\)</td><td>\(\beta_n-\gamma''\)</td></tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    Obviously, each column  \(\bar{\nabla_i} \) consists of unique values and contains one letter  \(\alpha_i \) of 
    the plaintext \(\bar{\alpha} \). You can try to recover this text using its 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(linguistics)">redundancy</a>. 
    Without going into details, here is one example for ‚Äúreading‚Äù in columns:

<div align="center">
    <table align="center">
       <tr align="center"><td>\(c\)</td><td>\(d\)</td><td>\(l\)</td><td>\(p\)</td><td>\(q\)</td><td>\(o\)</td><td>\(k\)</td><td>\(u\)</td><td>\(a\)</td><td>\(x\)</td><td>\(h\)</td><td>\(g\)</td></tr>
       <tr align="center"><td>\(y\)</td><td>\(r\)</td><td>\(y\)</td><td>\(w\)</td><td>\(t\)</td><td>\(j\)</td><td>\(g\)</td><td>\(r\)</td><td>\(b\)</td><td>\(p\)</td><td>\(m\)</td><td>\(y\)</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3 align="justify">If four letters were used for encryption, then the column depth would be equal to four. And if 
    all the letters were used, then the depth of the columns would be equal to $|A|$ and in this case you can read any
    text in them.</h3>

## General case

<p align="justify">
    Let's take a closer look at an example in which all letters from the alphabet \(A\) can be used as keystream 
    \(\bar{\gamma}\) values. In this case, there are also certain approaches for making up the columns \(\bar{\nabla}\).
    One of them is that in each column 
    \(\bar{\nabla_i}=(\alpha_i^{(1)}, \, \alpha_i^{(2)}, \, ... \, , \, \alpha_i^{(|A|)})\) the order of possible 
    plaintext letters \(\alpha_i^{(j)} \in A\) is determined by decreasing (more precisely, not increasing) their 
    probabilities:
    \[P(\alpha_i^{(j)} \, | \, \beta_i) = \frac{P(\alpha_i^{(j)}, \,  \beta_i)}{P(\beta_i)}=\frac{\phi(\alpha_i^{(j)}) 
    \cdot \varphi(\beta_i-\alpha_i^{(j)})}{\sum_{\alpha‚Äô \in A} \phi(\alpha‚Äô) \cdot \varphi(\beta_i-\alpha‚Äô)},\]
    \[i \in \{1, \, 2, \, ... \, , \, n\}, \; j \in \{1, \, 2, \, ... \, , \, |A|\},\]
    with a known fixed letter \(\beta_i \in A\) of the ciphertext \(\bar{\beta}\). Here \(\phi(\alpha), \; \alpha \in A\) is
    probability distribution of letters of meaningful texts for the alphabet \(A, \; \varphi (\gamma), \, \gamma \in A\) 
    is probability distribution of the \(\bar{\gamma}\) keystream values.

    <h3 align="justify">Also, for a more accurate ordering of letters in columns, their probabilities are calculated
    based on n-grams.</h3>

## Depth limitation

<p align="justify">
    The depth \(\bar{h}=(h_1, \, h_2, \, ... \, , \, h_n)\)  of the columns 
    \(\bar{\nabla}=(\bar{\nabla_1}, \, \bar{\nabla_2}, \, ... \, , \, \bar{\nabla_n})\) can be limited using a 
    pre-selected value of the \(\epsilon \in (0, 1]\) parameter:
    \[\begin{aligned} h_i=max\{\ell \in \{ 1, \, 2, \, ... \, , \, |A|\} : \sum_{j=1}^{\ell} 
    P(\alpha_i^{(j)} \, | \, \beta_i) \le \epsilon \}. \end{aligned}\]
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The critical depth of the columns \(\hat{h}\), at which it is possible to unambiguously determine the original 
    plaintext, is calculated by the formula:
    \[\begin{aligned} \hat{h}=|A|^{1 - H(A)}, \end{aligned}\]
    where \(H(A)\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a> of a language 
    with alphabet \(A\).

    <h3 align="justify">For English, \(\hat{h} \approx 13\).</h3>
